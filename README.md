# cdh_sim
Command &amp; Data Handling computer simulator

Python scripts intended to simulate a smallsat command and data handling computer.  
Goal is to provide a COSMOS target that will respond to the COSMOS application with properly formatted packets.
First goals include responding to ground commands for the VCC mission.  

This could be a very complex undertaking, depending on how 'real' the simulator is.
For now, just need something to send packets back to COSMOS on the downlink in response to uplink commands.

This might all be a dumb idea and a waste of time.......
